# Yet, another CMS system

Yes, yes, yes! This is another CMS system, written by node.js as backend and reactjs as front end.

## The reason of the project

I have a lot of clients need a quick and cheap(more affordable) solution to build the website for their business. Somehow, most quick way is to use wordpress. But there are some problem:
* wordpress is built on PHP and I don't like PHP
* wordpress is comparable complex the plugin is really a depending loops
* wordpress is slow

So, here comes this project. Another extendable, easy to develop CMS system written by javascript.
